As mentioned in the beginning of this project, you have some questions to ask yourself:

Solo or team?
What do I want to build?
How do I want to build it?
Is it possible to build it in less than 2 weeks?
Do I like what I’m doing?
When you know these answers, you will have to prepare a pitch:

Max 10min of pitch (please repeat to not go over)
Google slide presentation with:
Name of the project
List of team members
Description of the project
Learning objectives
Technologies used
Third services used if applicable
Challenges already identified
Schedule of work (by using Trello or Kanban board or other) - don’t forget that you have less then 4 weeks (27 days exactly)
Mock-ups if applicable
Please post your slides and the recording to your web-stack portfolio pitch here.

Let’s do it!

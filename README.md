As mentioned in the beginning of this project, you have some questions to ask yourself:

Solo or team?
What do I want to build?
How do I want to build it?

Do I like what I’m doing?
When you know these answers, you will have to prepare a pitch:

Google slide presentation with:
Name of the project
List of team members
Description of the project
Learning objectives..
Technologies used
